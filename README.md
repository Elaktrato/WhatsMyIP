# Viewing the Live App

You can view a live version of this app [here](https://Elaktrato.github.io/WhatsMyIP/).

# About the app
This project is part of the [WBS Coding School](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/) curriculum. Our purpose was to get some practice working with React and calling various APIs to obtain a similar functionality to something like [whatismyip.com/](https://www.whatismyip.com/)

# APIs and Libraries used
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for our UI
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) for the Map component integration
- [IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) for getting the user's IP address
- [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu/#rest-countries) for getting information about the user's country
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/index.html#/) for getting information about the user's timezone

## Running the app locally

You can run the app in development mode using `npm start`. This will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Warning about Ad-Blockers
If you're trying to see the site either locally or deployed, please disable your ad-blocking software as it can cause conflicts with the API fetches.

## Deployment

Using `npm run deploy`, you can deploy to GitHub Pages. We've implemented this following [these steps](https://chrisdevcode.hashnode.dev/github-pages-with-react).
